# Todo App Project

This is my first project as an aspiring front-end developer and web designer! I have taken this repository from [smthari's Frontend Projects](https://github.com/smthari/Frontend-Projects/tree/master/Todo-app) and added some enhancements to personalize it and improve my skills.

## About the Project

The Todo App is a simple and intuitive application that allows users to:
- Add tasks to a list.
- Mark tasks as completed.
- Delete tasks from the list.
- Save tasks in the browser's local storage, so they persist between sessions.

## Enhancements Made

1. **Favicon Added:**
   - I have added a favicon (logo in the browser's tab) to give the app a more polished and professional look.
   - The favicon is located in the project directory and integrated into the HTML `<head>` section.

2. **Header Logo:**
   - Added a logo at the top of the app to enhance the visual appeal and branding.
   - Styled the logo to ensure it fits well with the design and is responsive on different screen sizes.

## Features

- Interactive user interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Uses browser local storage to save tasks for later.
- Supports theme switching between light and dark modes.
- Clean and modular JavaScript code.

## Future Improvements

As I continue to grow my skills, I plan to:
- Improve the overall UI/UX design.
- Add animations for task additions, deletions, and status changes.
- Implement a search or filter feature for tasks.
- Enhance responsiveness further to make it more mobile-friendly.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/purva-phanse/to_do
   ```
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to run the app.
